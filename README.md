For this challenge i used jupyter and scraped several websites for data on the topic of the "Mission to Mars". The results of this activities were placed in a singlt HTML page. I then used css to style the table and bootstraped it as well. These are the steps i took;
I used Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Beautiful Soup and Splinter to write the web scraping code. 
Then in VS Code, I created two .py files 'web_scrape.py and app.py'. 
The code from Jupyter Notebook was placed in the web_scrape.py as functions. 
The app.py uses Flask and MongoDB for extract the data endpoints and store them. 
Finally, I created a table.html page for the data to be presented using Bootstrap and css.
